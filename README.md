# 🌐 Welcome to My Digital Playground!

Hey there! I'm **Audric**, a fresh UNSW Computer Science grad based in Sydney 🌇 who's passionate about **software engineering**, **data engineering**, and occasionally losing sleep over a machine learning model that won't converge 🤖💻

This is my **portfolio website** — a curated corner of the internet where I show off my projects, skills, and creative chaos. Whether you're here to hire me, stalk my GitHub, or just accidentally clicked a link, welcome! 🎉

## ✨ What You'll Find

- 🚀 Cool projects I’ve built (and actually finished!)
- 🧠 Skills in AI, web dev, data wrangling, and more
- 📚 A story of growth, grit, and Googling errors
- 🎨 A sprinkle of personality—because who said devs have to be boring?
